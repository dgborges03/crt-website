      We're a student-led group at <span class="text-orange-400 font-semibold">California Institute of Technology</span>.
      Our group consist of builders and engineers who love turning
      ideas into working machines. From combat robots and couch vehicles to drones,
      quadrupeds, and underwater robots, we push ourselves to create projects that
      are as fun as they are ambitious.

  <p class="mt-3 text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed font-body">
    CRT gives students the chance to design, prototype, and compete with robots of
    every shape and size. At a school with a strong focus on theoretical foundations,
    we believe it's just as important to get hands-on experience especially in the realm
    of robotics. This is from building, testing, and sometimes breaking things in the pursuit of learning. 
    Our team is where ideas move from whiteboards to workshops, transforming theory into practice 
    through creative, collaborative engineering.
